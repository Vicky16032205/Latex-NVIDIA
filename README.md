# 🧠 Research Paper Summarizer

Developed during an NVIDIA Internship, this project is an end-to-end platform that helps researchers quickly analyze and extract key insights from academic papers using semantic search, vector databases, LLM-powered summarization, and LaTeX PDF generation.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 📥 Upload PDFs of research papers via a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

- 🧠 Parse and embed the content using Llama Cloud API, Sentence Transformers, and convert to Markdown + JSON.

- 📚 Store embeddings in Milvus, a scalable vector database.

- 🔎 Perform Semantic Search based on user queries (content, abstract, images, etc.).

- 🧾 Generate Section-wise Summaries (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion, References, and even Figure Captions).

- 📄 Output a LaTeX-based PDF — beautifully structured, citation-ready, and exportable.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used


| Tool/Library               | Purpose                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Streamlit              | Web UI for uploading, searching |
| LlamaParse (Llama Cloud) | PDF parsing and Markdown generation                        |
| Pymilvus                    | 	Vector database storage/search                         |
| Sentence Transformers        | Embedding generation for search                          |
| Gemini API                | Summarization & captioning via LLMs                        |
| LaTeX (arxiv cls)                    | Academic formatting for output PDF          |

## 📦 Features

- 📂 Multi-PDF upload & processing.

- 📄 Markdown and JSON generation with structural hierarchy.

- 🖼️ Intelligent image extraction with auto-captioning.

- 🧠 Section-specific summarization (Abstract, Intro, Methods, etc.).

- 🧾 Formatted references in IEEE style.

- 🧑‍🔬 Literature review generation via citation understanding.

- 📊 Final output in a two-column LaTeX-formatted PDF (like IEEE/Arxiv style).

## 🚀 How It Works

1. 🔧 Upload and Process PDFs
   - PDFs are parsed and converted to Markdown + JSON.
   - Headings, subheadings, content, and images are extracted and embedded.

2. 💾 Store to Milvus
   - Data is vectorized and stored by topic/section-wise embeddings using Pymilvus.

3. 🔍 Semantic Search
   - Enter a query (e.g., "Convolution") to fetch top-matching excerpts.
   - Gemini API processes and summarizes the content per section.

4. 🧾 Generate PDF
   - Markdown output is converted to LaTeX using ToLatex.py.
   - A polished PDF is compiled with structure, images, and references.
