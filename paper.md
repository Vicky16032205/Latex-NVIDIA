## Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become a cornerstone of deep learning for image analysis, demonstrating effectiveness in various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation by learning spatial features through convolutional layers. Challenges persist regarding computational efficiency and adaptability to varying data complexities. While techniques like Neural Architecture Search (NAS) address these challenges, they often entail significant resource consumption. To mitigate these limitations, Self Expanding Neural Networks (SENN), inspired by neurogenesis, dynamically adjust network architecture during training, offering a promising avenue for adaptable and efficient models. This work introduces a Self Expanding Convolutional Neural Network (SECNN), extending the SENN concept to CNNs for vision tasks. The SECNN dynamically determines the optimal model size based on the task, eliminating the need for extensive architecture search and retraining, thereby enhancing efficiency and adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of feedforward trained CNNs, achieving competitive performance with backpropagation, particularly in neuromorphic hardware and unsupervised learning contexts, further expanding the understanding of neuronal information processing.


## Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have significantly advanced the field of deep learning, particularly in processing grid-like data such as images, demonstrating effectiveness in tasks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. This success stems from their ability to learn spatial features through convolutional layers that capture local patterns using shared weights implemented by kernels. Pooling layers further enhance this process by reducing spatial dimensions, enabling the network to focus on significant aspects.

Despite their widespread adoption, CNNs face challenges related to computational efficiency and adaptability. While architectures like MobileNet and EfficientNet have addressed efficiency, traditional CNNs with fixed architectures may not perform consistently across diverse input data with varying complexities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a method for optimizing neural network architectures, but it is often resource-intensive, demanding substantial computational power and energy. This highlights the need for adaptable and efficient architectures that avoid over-parameterization.

To address these limitations, this research investigates Self Expanding Convolutional Neural Networks (SECNNs), extending the concept of Self Expanding Neural Networks (SENN) initially applied to multilayer perceptrons. The objective is to develop a SECNN that dynamically adjusts its model size based on the task at hand, thus enhancing efficiency. This approach eliminates the need for training multiple CNN models of varying sizes and avoids restarting the training process after model expansion, representing a significant step toward adaptable and efficient CNN models for various vision-related tasks.

## Methodology
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized as a form of artificial neural network that leverages knowledge of specific input types to simplify network architecture, particularly in image analysis tasks. This approach shifts the focus from the entirety of the problem domain to specific, relevant features. Methodologically, the use of CNNs involves structuring the network with layers designed to exploit the properties of image data. One research direction explores a simplified model, such as the scattering transform based on wavelet transforms, to analyze CNN operations. The wavelet transform separates variations at different scales, contributing to feature transformation. Dynamically expanding CNN architectures can be developed, guided by an expansion criterion, such as a natural expansion score, to trigger model expansion. The research also involves labeling positive and negative data sets, crucial for training and evaluating the CNN model.


## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are biologically inspired neural networks that use convolutional filters and non-linearities to solve problems. Their architecture is designed to process image data effectively by organizing neurons into three dimensions: height, width, and depth. Unlike standard ANNs, neurons in a CNN layer connect only to a small region of the preceding layer.

### Convolutional Layer
The convolutional layer is central to CNN operation, utilizing learnable kernels to convolve across the input's spatial dimensions, generating 2D activation maps. These kernels detect specific features at spatial positions. Each kernel has a corresponding activation map, and the output volume's depth is set by the number of neurons. To mitigate the size of models from training ANNs on images, each convolutional neuron connects to a small region of the input volume, known as the receptive field.

The complexity of the model is reduced via hyperparameters such as depth, stride, and zero-padding. The output's spatial dimensionality can be calculated using the formula:

$$(V - R) + 2Z \\over S + 1$$

where $V$ is the input volume size, $R$ is the receptive field size, $Z$ is the zero-padding, and $S$ is the stride.

Parameter sharing further reduces the number of parameters by constraining each activation map to the same weights and bias, which is based on the assumption that a region feature useful in one spatial location is likely to be useful in another.

### CNN Architecture
CNN architecture focuses on processing image-based inputs, organizing neurons in layers across three dimensions: spatial dimensionality (height and width) and depth. The depth signifies the third dimension of an activation volume. The input 'volume' will have a dimensionality of height $\\times$ width $\\times$ depth, leading to a final output layer comprised of a dimensionality of $1 \\times 1 \\times n$, where $n$ represents the possible number of classes.

### Convolutional Neural Networks
CNNs compute each subsequent layer $x_j$ as:

$$x_j = \u03c1W_jx_{j-1}$$

where $W_j$ is a linear operator (typically a convolution), and $\u03c1$ is a non-linearity (e.g., rectifier or sigmoid). The layers are filter maps and each layer can be written as a sum of convolutions of the previous layer:

$$x_j(u, k_j) = \u03c1(\\sum_k (x_{j-1}(., k) * W_{j,k_j}(., k))(u))$$

Here $*$ is the discrete convolution operator:

$$(f * g)(x) = \\sum_{u=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(u)g(x - u)$$

The weights $W_j$ are learned by stochastic gradient descent using backpropagation.

### General Convolutional Neural Network Architectures
General CNN architectures extend the analysis of single-channel convolutions to allow for channel combinations, using tools developed by Mallat. This extension involves replacing contractions and invariants to translations by contractions along adaptive groups of local symmetries, and wavelets are replaced by adapted filter weights.

### A Mathematical Framework for CNNs
Mallat introduced a mathematical framework for analyzing CNNs based on wavelet scattering, illustrating that computing invariants requires separating variations of X at different scales with a wavelet transform.

### Continuous Wavelet Transform
The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) captures variations in $f$ at a particular scale and provides a foundation for the operation of CNNs. It is defined as:

$$\\tilde{f}(s, t) \u2261 (f * \u03c8_s)(t)$$

where $*$ is the continuous convolution operator:

$$(p * q)(x) \u2261 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(u)q(x - u)du$$
and
$$\u03c8_s(u) \u2261 |s|^{-p}\u03c8(\\frac{u}{s})$$

## Results
The experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 image classification revealed notable performance metrics across multiple trials. Specifically, achieving 70% validation accuracy required approximately 11,360 parameters on average, while reaching 80% validation accuracy necessitated a significantly larger parameter count, averaging 33,655.2. The highest validation accuracy attained across these trials averaged 84.1%, achieved with a mean of 62,698.4 parameters. Furthermore, a methodology for implementing Class Activation Maps using FeedForward trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was demonstrated, providing a tool for enhancing the explainability of AI models.


## Conclusion
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) represent a cornerstone in deep learning-based image analysis, offering advantages over traditional methods through their capacity to exploit spatial information and facilitate explainable AI tools like class activation maps. The core innovation of CNNs lies in their ability to focus on specific input features, leading to simpler network architectures compared to other artificial neural networks. Research has strived to simplify and understand CNN operations, with approaches like the scattering transform providing insights into their feature transformation processes built upon wavelet transforms.

Recent advancements explore novel training methodologies, such as FeedForward (FF) trained CNNs, which demonstrate competitive performance relative to backpropagation with appropriate hyperparameter optimization. These techniques hold promise for addressing real-world computer vision challenges, particularly in neuromorphic hardware and unsupervised learning scenarios. Further research is needed to understand the individual and synergistic contributions of positive and negative labeling within FF training, and to explore its potential in training deeper networks and handling more complex datasets. Additionally, expanding on the work of Lorberbom et al. (2023) to better understand the ability of FF training to work with larger and more complex data sets needs to be explored.

Furthermore, dynamically expanding architectures, such as the Self Expanding Convolutional Neural Network, offer computationally efficient solutions for determining optimal architectures for vision tasks, eliminating the need for multiple training iterations. Future studies could focus on further optimization of these dynamically expanding architectures with more complex datasets. The connection to biological neuronal systems also remains a promising research avenue, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence.
