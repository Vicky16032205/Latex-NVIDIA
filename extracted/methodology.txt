This in turn allows for a much simpler network architecture to be set up.\n\nThis paper has outlined the basic concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks, explaining the layers required to build one and detailing how best to structure the network in most image analysis tasks.\n\nResearch in the field of image analysis using neural networks has somewhat slowed in recent times. This is partly due to the incorrect belief surrounding the level of complexity and knowledge required to begin modelling these superbly powerful machine learning algorithms. The authors hope that this paper has in some way reduced this confusion, and made the field more accessible to beginners.",

The analysis of general CNN architectures was not considered in this paper, but even this analysis is only a first step towards a full mathematical understanding of convolutional neural networks.",
