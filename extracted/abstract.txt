                "text": "CNNs are considered the gold standard in deep learning-based image analysis. For instance, in biomedical imaging, they overcome the drawbacks of subjective analysis in the semi-quantitative visual inspection of samples (Gurcan et al., 2009), and they support experts\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Class activation maps (CAMs) of a FF trained CNN show which image regions are considered beneficial (yellow) or deleterious (pink) by the network for making its prediction. (A), (C), (E), and (G) display four input images. (B), (D), (F), and (H) are their corresponding CAMs. All examples are from a network with 16 convolutional neurons per layer, filter size 5x5, and trained with a batch size of 50.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Class activation maps show that the different layers of the FF-trained CNN provide similar, but yet distinguishable information. (A) shows the CAM obtained from considering both layer 2 and layer 3 together. (B) and (C) show the CAMs obtained respectively only from layer 2 and layer 3.\n\nduring their daily clinical routine by reducing their workload (Shmatko et al., 2022). Furthermore, their exploitation of the spatial information within images makes them suitable for the deployment of explainable AI tools (such as class activation maps), which highlight the image regions contributing most significantly to the classification outcome. Our implementation of FF trained CNN shows that with the right choice of hyperparameters, this technique is competitive with backpropagation. These results were obtained without implementing all the possible and suggested optimizations such as enforcing symmetry of the loss function (Lee and Song, 2023) or choosing hard, i.e. easily confused, labels for the negative data set, as suggested by Hinton (2022). We propose that our work shows the\n\n13\n\nSCODELLARO, KULKARNI, ALVES AND SCHR\u00d6TER\n\npotential of FF trained CNNs to address real world computer vision problems. An open question remains if this technique will supersede BP in specific applications. We believe that this potential exists, especially in the cases of neuromorphic hardware and unsupervised learning.\n\nA better understanding of the FF training will however also expand our understanding of the generic concept of neuronal information processing in all its breadth from biological systems to reservoir computing. The demonstrated capability to implement class activation maps offers an initial insight into these research topics. Achieving deeper insights will also mean to understand how the two innovations of FF, providing positive and negative labels and computing a locally defined goodness parameter, contribute to its success individually and synergetically (Tosato et al., 2023). Moreover, a better understanding why it is beneficial to exclude the first layer during the goodness computation (c.f. Appendix B) would be desirable. Subsequent work on FF training should also address its ability to train deeper networks, most likely expanding on the work of Lorberbom et al. (2023). Also the ability of FF training to work with larger and more complex data sets needs to be explored. Finally, its connection to biological neuronal systems (Ororbia and Mali, 2023; Ororbia, 2023) seems a promising research direction.",

                "text": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of deep learning, especially in processing grid-like data structures such as images [1]. Their effectiveness in tasks like image classification [2, 3], object detection [4, 5], semantic segmentation [6, 7] and image generation [8] stem from their ability to effectively learn spatial features. Convolutional layers, using filters or kernels, capture local patterns and extract features from input images. One important feature of convolutional layers is the shared weights implemented by kernels. This allows for efficient deep learning on images, as using only fully connected layers for such tasks would result in unfathomable numbers of parameters. Pooling layers, like max pooling and average pooling, reduce the spatial dimensions of these features, helping the network to focus on the most significant aspects.\n\nDespite their popularity, CNNs face challenges in computational efficiency and adaptability. There have been several convolutional neural network architectures that have been proposed that are aimed at efficiency. Some of such architectures include MobileNet [12] and EfficientNet [13]. However, such traditional CNNs, with fixed architectures and number of parameters, may not perform uniformly across different types of input data with varying levels of complexity.\n\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS), a method for selecting optimal neural network architectures, has been a response to this challenge. NAS aims to obtain the best model for a specific task under certain constraints [14]. However, NAS is often resource-intensive due to the need to train multiple candidate models. in order to determine the optimal architecture. It is estimated that the carbon emission produced when using NAS to train a transformer model can amount to five times the lifetime carbon emissions of an average car [15]. This highlights the importance of finding suitable\n\narchitectures for neural networks, yet also points to the limitations of current approaches in terms of static structure and proneness to over-parameterization.\n\nSelf Expanding Neural Networks (SENN), introduced in [9], offer a promising direction. Inspired by neurogenesis, SENN dynamically adds neurons and fully connected layers to the architecture during training using a natural expansion score (defined in section 2.1) as a criteria to guide this process. This helps overcome the problem of over-parametrization. However, its application has been limited to multilayer perceptrons, with extensions to more practical architectures like CNNs identified as a future research prospect.\n\nOur study aims to develop a Self Expanding Convolutional Neural Network (SECNN), building on the concept of SENN and applying it to modern vision tasks. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no research on Self Expanding CNNs, despite the potential they hold for addressing model efficiency and adaptability in vision tasks. Unlike existing approaches that often require restarting training after modifications or rely on preset mechanisms for expansion, our approach utilizes the natural expansion score for dynamic and optimal model expansion. This research represents a significant step in developing adaptable, efficient CNN models for a variety of vision-related tasks.\n\nThe contributions of this research are as follows:\n\n- Developing a Self Expanding CNN that dynamically determines the optimal model size based on the task, thereby enhancing efficiency.\n- Eliminating the need to train multiple CNN models of varying sizes by allowing for the extraction of checkpoints at diverse complexity levels.\n- Eliminating the need to restart the training process after expanding the CNN model.",
